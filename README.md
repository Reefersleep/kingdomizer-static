## Kingdomizer - A dominion randomizer!

### The story of abandoned work of love

I _love_ the board game Dominion. 

In setting up a game, you will benefit in speed (and practicality) from using a digital randomizer for picking your cards. 

When I was learning to love Dominion, there were a number of native apps for this purpose, but no good browser app. I decided I wanted to try my hand at it, and [Kingdomizer](http://kingdomizer.netlify.com) is the result.

Before it became anything near as good as I wanted it to be, somebody else put out a better solution. Now, https://dominionrandomizer.com is my go-to randomizer. It's beautiful, slick and hasa the things you want. Go there for your randomization needs!

I really just keep Kingdomizer around for sentimental reasons. I mean, it _works_ to _some_ degree, but it is far from feature complete, even for basic randomization.

### Development stuff
To run tests; `lein doo nodejs test` (you need to have nodejs installed)
